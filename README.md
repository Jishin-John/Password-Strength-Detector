A machine learning web app built using Python and Streamlit that predicts password strength as Weak, Medium, or Strong.
It uses a trained model (password_strength_model.pkl) to analyze password features such as length, digits, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.
The app also estimates the time required to crack a password through brute-force attacks.
Helps users create more secure passwords by providing real-time feedback and strength analysis.
